== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to add template tags to my theme? =

You should not have to change your templates. 
The Social Sharing Icons seamlessly integrate into your blog by using predefined hooks.

= Does the Social Sharing Icons can be embedded through a shortcode? =

The Social Sharing shortcode `[oa_social_sharing_icons]` can be used in any page or post within your blog.
The shortcode will automatically be replaced by the icons of the chosen social network providers.

= I have a custom template and the plugin is not displayed correctly =

The plugin uses predefined hooks. If your theme does not support these hooks,
you can add the Social Sharing Icons manually to your theme by inserting the following code 
in your template (at the location where it should be displayed, i.e. after the posts).

`<?php do_action('oa_social_sharing_icons'); ?>`

Do not hesitate to contact us if you need further assistance.
